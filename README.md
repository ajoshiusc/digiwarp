This is implementation of our paper:

A. A. Joshi, A. J. Chaudhari, C. Li, J. Dutta, S. R. Cherry, D. W. Shattuck, A. W. Toga and R. M. Leahy, DigiWarp: a method for deformable mouse atlas warping to surface topographic data, Physics in Medicine and Biology, 55(20), 6197-6214.


There are 2 main scripts.
main_select_points_for_reorientation.m and main_digiwarp.m

Start with main_select_points_for_reorientation.m
Please read comments in the matlab script. You can use this script to select a set of initial points on the subject and atlas to get an approximate alignment.
